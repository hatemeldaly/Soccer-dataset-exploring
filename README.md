1. Best rated players
2. Best potential rated players
3. Tallest players
4. Shortest players
5. Oldest players
6. Youngest players
7. Players with most appearances

10. Total number of goals for each League
11. Relation between home and away wins
12. Team with most wins
13. Team with most home wins
14. Team with most away wins
15. What team attributes lead to the most victories?
16. What teams improved the most over the time period?
